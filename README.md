# thedailyjournal
A journal fit for daily input, whether to keep tabs on dues or to build the positive habit of reflection through text.

For the longest time I’ve been trying to get into the habit of writing daily both for creative and reflective purposes. I am going to use this project as an opportunity to create a journal program out of Tkinter hopefully bringing motivation towards using a personalized software. There are many examples of similar projects on Github under diaries and journals, so I’ll cross reference to find the best use of code.

Approach for Making the Program
- [x] 1. Mess Around with Tkinter and Create a Frame to Hold the Program.
- [x] 2. Add a Text Input Field for User Input
- [ ] 3. Form a Directory for Where the Entries Will go. 
- [ ] 4. Make a Way to Access Previous Entries.
- [ ] 5.Add a search bar to efficiently google things.
- [ ] 6.Give the user options to customize the UI (Colors Etc.)
- [ ] 7.Focus on security, whether password protection or facial recognition

Lastly I, Aleksandr Yeger will be the only one working on this project.
