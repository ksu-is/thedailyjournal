# thedailyjournal
For the longest time I’ve been trying to get into the habit of writing daily both for creative and reflective purposes. I am going to use this project as an opportunity to create a journal program out of Tkinter hopefully bringing motivation towards using a personalized software. There are many examples of similar projects on Github under diaries and journals, so I’ll cross reference to find the best use of code. https://github.com/topics/diary-application

Features will include:
•	Tkinter UI
•	Date and Time stamps
•	Interactive Calendar
•	Access to Previous Entries
•	Customizable UI
•	User Select Journal Titles


Objective: To create a program for organization and goalkeeping to enhance productivity and to build a constructive habit. 
Potential: Include sentiment analysis by using google: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/sentiment-tutorial. Also might include encryption option for privacy and security.
