# thedailyjournal
A journal fit for daily input, whether to keep tabs on dues or to build the positive habit of reflection through text.

For the longest time I’ve been trying to get into the habit of writing daily both for creative and reflective purposes. I am going to use this project as an opportunity to create a journal program out of Tkinter hopefully bringing motivation towards using a personalized software. There are many examples of similar projects on Github under diaries and journals, so I’ll cross reference to find the best use of code.
    
Lastly I will be the only one working on this project.
